# Lugaru-model-solid2obj-converter
A Java based GUI conversion tool to convert .solid files from Lugaru game to .obj and vice versa.

## How do I use it?
1. **Download the Jar from releases** (https://github.com/scythianwizard/Lugaru-model-solid2obj-converter/releases)
2. Have a .solid file (or an obj if you want to convert to .solid) (You can get models from OSS Lugaru Source https://gitlab.com/osslugaru/lugaru/-/tree/master/Data/Models?ref_type=heads)
3. If making a .solid from obj, **Make sure you select the type** (Body, weapon, immovable)
4. Convert
5. You may want to check the detected type after conversion. 

## Screenshot
Here's a screenshot of what the GUI looks like

## Why does this exist?
Because the blender scripts on wolfire forums won't work on newer Blender versions.
Also to enable users who want to mod Lugaru without blender support.

## Acknowledgements
The code is mostly based on findings of rudel_ic on official wolfire forums.
